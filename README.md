# C64 experiments
This repository collects my C64 software development exploits. I got my first computer in 1994 (a 40Mhz AMD 486 DX40 with 4Mb of RAM and a 250Mb harddisk) so I missed out on the 8-bit era. I do find it fun and revigorating to go back and write software for the C64.

I only get around to writing 6502 assembly sporadically so these are mostly simple programs, with heavily commented code. It's mostly intended to provide a quick refresher for myself, but it might by useful to anybody else.

Seasoned C64 vets will probably frown at most of this code. If you've got (constructive) criticims, please don't hesitate to drop my a line.
